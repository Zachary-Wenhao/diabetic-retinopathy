HOW THE COMPUTER LEARNS TO READ EYE PHOTOS
-------------------------------------------

TRAINING DATA:
• The computer learned from 2,929 real eye photos
• These photos came from patients who were around 49 years old on average
• About half were men and half were women
• Doctors had already looked at each photo and labeled it

WHAT THE COMPUTER LEARNED:
• It learned to recognize 5 different levels of eye disease
• It studied patterns in the blood vessels at the back of your eye
• It learned what healthy eyes look like vs. sick eyes

WHERE THE COMPUTER LOOKS:
• The model focuses on blood vessels and their patterns
• It looks for dark spots, which can be bleeding
• It checks for red areas, which can be swelling
• It examines the overall structure of blood vessels

WHAT MAKES EYES DIFFERENT:

Healthy Eyes (Class 0: 1432 photos):
• Clear, organized blood vessels
• No dark spots or bleeding
• Uniform color across the eye

Mild Disease (Class 1: 307 photos):
• Small changes starting to appear
• Tiny spots that might indicate early problems
• Blood vessels still mostly normal

Moderate Disease (Class 2: 800 photos):
• More visible changes
• Blood vessels showing damage
• Dark spots becoming more obvious

Severe Disease (Class 3: 156 photos):
• Significant blood vessel damage
• Multiple dark spots (bleeding)
• Clear signs of serious problems

Advanced Disease (Class 4: 234 photos):
• Extensive damage throughout the eye
• New, abnormal blood vessels growing
• High risk of vision loss

WHY THIS MATTERS FOR SCREENING:
• The computer can quickly check photos in areas without eye doctors
• It helps identify people who need to see a specialist right away
• It's not perfect, so human doctors still need to confirm
• Think of it as a helpful first check, not the final answer

IMPORTANT REMINDERS:
• This tool is for screening only, not diagnosis
• A real eye doctor must always review positive cases
• The computer works best with clear, well-lit photos
• Poor quality photos may give wrong results
