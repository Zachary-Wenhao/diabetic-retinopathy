The computer is 99% confident about this result.

This is a high confidence score. The computer is very sure about what it saw.

HOW THE COMPUTER ANALYZES YOUR EYE
------------------------------------------------------------

The computer uses a technique called 'Grad-CAM' to highlight areas that help it make decisions. This shows which parts of your eye it focused on:

• Blood vessels and their patterns
• Areas that might show bleeding or fluid leakage
• Changes in the retina structure
• Overall eye health indicators

The colored highlight areas in your report show where the computer 'looked' most carefully.
