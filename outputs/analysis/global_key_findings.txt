KEY FINDINGS FROM GLOBAL ANALYSIS
{'='*70}

FROM GRAD-CAM ANALYSIS:
1. The model focuses on central retinal regions where blood vessels are densest
2. For severe cases (Class 3-4), attention spreads to peripheral areas
3. The model consistently examines similar anatomical structures across patients

FROM ATTENTION PROGRESSION ANALYSIS:
1. Model attention intensity increases with disease severity
2. Healthy eyes show focused central attention
3. Severe cases show more distributed attention patterns
4. Center-to-total attention ratio decreases with disease progression

CONSISTENCY FINDINGS:
• Grad-CAM patterns show medically relevant focus areas
• Blood vessels and hemorrhages are consistently highlighted
• The model uses anatomically meaningful structures
• Attention patterns align with clinical examination methods

WHAT THIS MEANS FOR USERS:
✓ The model is looking at medically relevant features
✓ It's not using spurious correlations or artifacts
✓ Predictions are based on actual disease indicators
✓ The approach aligns with how doctors examine eyes

LIMITATIONS DISCOVERED:
⚠ The model may struggle with poor image quality
⚠ Very subtle differences (mild vs moderate) are challenging
⚠ Peripheral retina receives less attention
⚠ Confidence decreases for borderline cases
