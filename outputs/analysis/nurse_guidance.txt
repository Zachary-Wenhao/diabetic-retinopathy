GUIDANCE FOR NURSES AND VOLUNTEERS (8th Grade Level)
======================================================================

WHEN TO TRUST THE MODEL:

✓ HIGH CONFIDENCE (90% or higher)
  - The model is right 80% of the time
  - These results are usually reliable
  - Still recommend follow-up based on the diagnosis

⚠ MEDIUM CONFIDENCE (70-90%)
  - The model is right 51% of the time
  - Use extra caution with these results
  - Consider getting a second opinion or referral

⚠️ LOW CONFIDENCE (Below 70%)
  - The model is less sure about these results
  - ALWAYS have an eye specialist review these cases
  - Don't make decisions based on these results alone

WHAT THE MODEL IS GOOD AT:
• Finding severe and advanced eye disease (Classes 3-4)
• Identifying healthy eyes with no disease (Class 0)

WHAT THE MODEL STRUGGLES WITH:
• Telling the difference between mild and moderate disease
• Borderline cases that are between two levels
• Poor quality or dark images

IMPORTANT REMINDERS:
• This is a screening tool, not a diagnosis
• ALL positive results should be referred to an eye specialist
• When in doubt, ALWAYS refer the patient
• Image quality matters - retake if image is blurry or dark
